Files:
	- file of my bets (need structure for this one)
	- file to make a bet (using tkinter)
	- file to update results of my bets, analyze


process to record a bet:
1. I fire up the tkinter program from command line / jupyter notebook
2. It asks me for bettor, league
3. It shows me games coming up in that league
4. I select a game
5. It shows me the available bets for that game (using its ESPN_ID)
6. I select a bet, enter the bet amount (it computes to win amount)
7. the jupyter notebook shows me what it looks like
	a. including pulling in data from prod table
8. I verify it looks good and save the bet to my personal bets csv
9. program updates results from updated espn data

data needed from tkinter for bet df:
- bettor
- league
- it shows bets in the league, I pick one

- parlay info, #
- bet type (ml, spread, over_under)
- amount bet
- amount to win


data I can get elsewhere and bring in:
- bet ID (create)
- dt bet was made (compute)
- all info from ESPN_ID can come from prod table
