data sources:
- espn df's
- odds
- esb odds

current prod
- loads all, merges, calculates records

revisions
- rewrite odds csv's to have one row per game - would make merging easy and fast




want to have a prod and just tack on new stuff, or make it super fast to make a new one


data to calculate once and store somewhere
- team record cols -> ESPN df (need full league games tho)
- 

need a way to update the prod table efficiently


1. make prod table with calculated records
2. udpate prod table as games/results change
