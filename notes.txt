10 days free until work again (likely time free then too)

things to work on:
- sports betting code
- reading coders book
- follow simple routine on momentum (night 3min, viz, )
- tensorflow in practice
- sports betting book! and others :)


get sb data to a point where it's totally ready for modeling, along with being able to predict new games in 2020. Then, go through tf in practice and experiment on my dataset as I'm going through it
